# CLASS NOTES:
	
__NARROW YOUR FOCUS AUDIENCE FARTHER AND FARTHER AND FARTHER DOWN UNTIL YOU ARE SUPER SUPER FOCUSED AND ONLY DESIGN THE SITE FOR THEM. MAKE IT USEABLE AND GREAT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO USE/SEE IT, BUT AIM IT FULLY AND COMPLETELY AT YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE.__

- __DO NOT publish a site early. Do not.__ It needs to go through the cycle of construction/development—>quality assurance/users testing it several times first.

- Then after it IS finally published, you start ongoing maintenance, and that may take you back to the requirements and specifications stage or the creation stage or re-vamping/re-development and then even back through the "quality assurance/user testing" process too—and maybe even several times before you publish a new change to it again!

## FOR CLIENT SITE PROJECT:
	- Who 
	- Create a mission statement for what we want to get out of this. What does he want for this site? Who is his target audience? What are they like? How will they likely be using the site?
	- Is the site an update of an existing site (or a completely new site, or a new site to replace an old site)?
		- What are sites that are similar to what he (the client) wants?
	- Audience—what kind of group... How will they be looking at it? Will it mostly be on their iPhones, or something else?
	
- It's smart to have two people taking notes on something, not just one, because if one hears one thing but the other hears something different, or if one misses something, the other one likely has it. It's much smoother and safer and less stressful for everyone.
		
- There are some example site specifications on Joel Sklar's website in the page for [Ch. 3] (http://www.joelsklar.com/pwd6/chapter3.html)
		
- Is this actually a good resource for website planning? This one could be useful, idk (I just found it through a google search in chrome, look up later): https://www.jumpchart.com/
