# MARCH 21st CLASS NOTES

* "Web as new host platform and HTML5 is the new OS"

* Think for a minute about whether you use the web and services and access things more on a desktop or on some kinds of mobile devices, or at least a mix of the two? 
	- So it has to become more responsive. It has to become more able to work with everything.
	
* Previously in HTML there were A LOT of <div> tags. Everywhere.
	- The new HTML5 system makes code a lot cleaner and less complicated
	
* One of the good things about using a **natural flow** kind of page layout is that you don't have to worry about having a lot of sections or having complicated layout structure rules to keep everything looking really precise, because it's natural and easy to follow and one nice long linear flow. (IS IT??? I need to double check what the definition of a "natural flow" really is, because it might be more general than this narrow definition example I'm trying to use that is like what You Need A Budget Uses)

* Things have changed a lot in the last several years. You have a lot more power and options for making things work across devices and browsers with a lot of flexibility...but it's a lot harder.

* Rules have changed! Used to be, you want all your information to fit on the screen. You never want users to scroll down. Now? It's completely flipped to the opposite. Everyone with mobile devices—and as a result, desktops now too—are constantly scrolling. THere are a lot of designs that are completely based on an assumption of scrolling to see the different pieces of content, and they can be really, really awesome.

* What it really comes down to is being able to read the code so you can go to the sites that have what you like and want to do design-wise and see how it works so you can understand, copy, and innovate with it on your own.

## My teacher, on looking at the source code for NASA's website (I had thrown it out as an example of a website whose menu shrank into a hamburger menu form when the browser/device/screen size gets smaller)

     "Goodness gracious they have so much stuff in here..."

     "They are prepared for _everything_."
	
* It even checks all the different internet browsers, and can throw out a window that says "Did you know that your Internet Browser is out of date?" and recommends upgrading to the newest version so that you can be sure that all the things on the website will work and show up perfectly.

## Important Thoughts:
* **The devices we use to access the web have changed how we mentally think about presenting and viewing content, and how we think about the entire situation as a whole.**

     What we have now ()with HTML5, CSS3, etc.) gives us the ability to design, control, and innovated so much more than we could in the past. But at the same time, there's a lot more you have to think about, manage, keep track of, check on all the time, and specify than there was in the past. So while you can do more, better, it's a lot of work and can be very difficult and complicated sometimes. But the results are so, so totally worth it.
	
## To Summarize: 
     **HTML5 in a nutshell:** With great power comes great responsibility.
