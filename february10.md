# ASSIGNMENTS COMING UP:
	
- READ CHAPTER 3 AND SEND IN THE THREE SENTENCE QUESTIONS AND STUFF
	
- Start working on the next thing nowâ€”Updates to the About Me Page
		- Should have two pages now
		- An image on at least one page
		- Existing page must link to new page
		- One of the pages must have a table
		
# CLASS NOTES:
		
- DIV: splits the page into different containers, pieces

- How do I view the source (HTML/CSS code) in browsers on my iPad?
		- EDIT: apparently, there's no built-in way to do it on the iPad (at least for the Safari and Chrome browsers; I can't speak for others). __You can do it in Safari if you buy the "View Source" app on the iOS app store__

- Start learning and experimenting from the CSS inspiration and examples on http://www.csszengarden.com/

## I FOUND AN ANSWER TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON MY LIST!
	- Comments in HTML are indeed <!--...--> and used for anything from labeling things to putting in guides to notes for yourself to sarcastic commentaries about the content on your page or whatever. 
		+ You can also use them to hide portions of your page that you're going to use immediately and don't want to just shove in a different file or re-write later on, but don't want to be a part of the active/visible code right now.
	- Comments in CSS ARE different, just like I had guessed they probably would be! You use "C code" (whatever that means? C language? idk) comments, like this: /* comment text */
	
- COMMENTS: commented code is easier to transfer from one person to another, help test the code, help understand what a developer intended, etc. I think they can also be funny.
