# UPCOMING ASSIGNMENTS:

## "ABOUT ME" PAGE ASSIGNMENT
- We're not loading it into Canvas this year, she changed it because we now have the ability to use MUSites, which no other class had before. So now we're UPLOADING IT TO MUSITES and then PASTING THE URL into the assignment submission area in Canvas so she can find and see it.

## WEDNESDAY:
- Our about me pages are due, make sure they work on MUSites, we'll be looking at them and pulling them up in class


# CLASS NOTES:
- You have to make your website visible to people who have different kinds and ages of browsers.
		+ Amazon has to make its site as flexible as possible because they want people to buy from them and to do that they have to be able to see the products
		+ Craigslist does adapt to a smaller screen, although their site could still drive you crazy with a million links on it
		
- The craigslist page is ugly, and we don't really like looking it, but by darn you can view it anywhere from any browser without trouble, most likely!

- "caniuse.com" "quirksmode.com/compatibility.html" can give you combatibility information for different browsers with different pieces of code and stuff

- A / on a URL means it's within the public folder of a website (but on same level as index or default if it's a url that ends with .html?)

- Website Process:
	- Write the code documents
		+ Upload them to your server using FTP (That's putting it in a directory)
			
- When a webpage takes FOREVER to load initially, but then loads much faster each time you do it after that, it's using cache to pull the page much faster
		+ The first time it takes much longer because it has to load every image, every word, every everything, and store them in the files (of a cache!). It pulls everything and starts putting it in some kind of setup for you to see it.
		+ If you go to your history in your browser, then the browser goes "well hang on, I've already been to this page," and "well I've already got this image, and I've already got this," and it'll take everything that you've already got on your machine and try to just search for changes and fill them in instead of going through the entire process
		+ If you're ever reloading and reloading a page and it's just not showing anything up, this can be what's happening. Because the browser is saying it already had it, but maybe you changed the image since the last time you uploaded it. So you uploaded it and you're refreshing it, but if it's the same name and size, and you're replacing it and showing it again, then it might take a while until you're actually able to see it.
		
__THIS CAN BE A PROBLEM! The computer is saying "it's all good, I already got this!" but the file has actually been changed, even if the names and sizes and everything, and it can take a while for the changes to register and be noticed and displayed by the browser.__
		+ So that's bad if you're trying to check changes to something, or make edits, etc.
		
- Being in the US, we have a lot of bandwidth usually. So we don't have a lot of trouble with seeing any websites, usually. But people in other countries/areas don't have that across the board, and they might have a lot of trouble seeing a site.

- HARD REFRESH: clears the cache, full reload, so you can see what it really looks like for someone that hasn't loaded it a bunch of times already.

- Dude. Can I take an anthropological linguisitcs class in college? That would be so awesome. Or just any linguistics class. Rad.

- I love the hamburger menu. I really, really love using the hamburger menu. It's so awesome to have one simple place. Just one simple place! I love it. Gosh I love it.
		+ YO! It's also apparently really good for people who are visually impaired and using site-reading software, because it'll say something like "Menu available" instead of reading every single choice in it, because it's not currently immediately visible.
		
- With websites, it used to be, all the navigation was visible all the time, and very little content was visible. But now the pages are super long with people scrolling all the time, and the page just gets longer and longer as the screen size gets smaller.
		
- If you see a website with the old stuff in there, you're probably not aware of this but you're probably judging the website as you're looking at it.

** ACTIVE vs. PASSIVE WHITE SPACE: Active white space is white space we've created to separate things out on the page, between headings and paragraphs and sections and photos and borders and stuff. They make it easier to see things. Passive white space is blank areas where there is no element on the page, no box of text or image or style formatting and stuff.
		+ DEPTH. If it's touching, it loses all the depth. If you have separation, you can tell that they're different. If you have things up against each other, it makes the page or image or whatever it is look very flat.

- "WRAPPERS in HTML" Whole page —> div with the basic part of what they have —> columns within it, main part of the page —> pieces that build it, the blocks, with different backgrounds and borders sometimes.
		+ Creating different groupings by making just tiny changes. Tiny white border, a little more spacing, different size, different headings, etc.
		
- If you have a row of images, if they were all different sizes, you wouldn't be able to scan right down them. Your eye couldn't do that.

- PROPORTIONS - within the main block of a page box, maybe it's four square images wide, but has images only on the left side, taking up 1/4 of the box, and the other 3/4 of it is text content with headings and paragraphs or something. Like on the STL Zoo site page about mammals.

- The columns of a page can be broken into rows, and some things can go across more than one column (as well as rows, obviously, that's always).

- In languages that read from right to left, not left to right, the sites use the same design rules, but they all flip from left side to right side. Important parts, text directions, and main structure pieces all start from the right.
