# MARCH 28th CLASS:

	Images and color on web pages
	
## Image File Types:
* There are four image types
	* .jpg
	* .gif
	* .png
	* .svg (vector graphic)
* Pointillism—painting technique that uses dots of color to form an image. Distinct dots, but put together they let you see an image.
	* That's the exact same thing that happens with our images today, with pixels, megapixels, compacted together into a photograph.
* Which kind of image is better?
	* It depends on what you're trying to do and how you want to use the image.
	* [looking at youneedabudget.com for examples]
	* Pictures of people should usually be jpgs
		* They can use lots and lots and lots of different colors
	* Images without a lot of different colors are often gifs
		* You can do a lot with gifs
		* But there are only 256 colors in a gif
			* It only has to keep track of 256 colors, that's it
			* You can take a _true_ gif and expand it out and it'll still look the same, it'll be fine
	* png combines the best of both—as many colors as a jpg, transparency ability like a gif, and doesn't take up as much space as a jpg
	* svg is what comes from Adobe Illustrator. Vector graphics. Beautiful and awesome at all sizes, especially good on retina displays.
	
	### Copyrights: 
	* Any piece of original work **CAN** be copyrighted, provided that it was created by a human being. (That last part was courtesy of the monkey selfie incident, debates, and court case.)

## Colors:
* Warm colors or cool colors
	* Warm—emotion, feel good, community
	* Cool—rationality, convincing, credibility
* dO NOT mix Red and Blue (or Red and Green)
	* Why
	* Please
	* Do Not
	* Don't do that
	* Red on blue or blue on red will almost look pulsing because of how the cones in your eyes process it
		* "Is it red?" —> "Is it green?" —> "Is it blue?" —> "Then it must be some form of yellow lol"
		* Also your rods, which process and determine contrast.
			* Dogs have very strong rods—they can see a lot of contrast really well but they can't see very many colors
			* Shrimp have such well-developed cones that they can see many more shades of color than we can. They're herbivores, they need to.
			* Many athletes and video gamers have good rods—they have to be able to see contrast (and as a result, movement and difference and danger) better
	* If you're gonna put red and blue together, HAVE SOMETHING SEPARATING THEM. Usually white space. Please. Please.
* ALSO, Complimentary Colors don't always work well together, because there's such a heavy contrast between their intense shades. Your eyes can't figure out whether they're a color problem or a contrast problem.
* Gradients can help
	* Usually lighter at the top and darker at the bottom
	* In photography, the light that looks the best is the light where you're lit from nature
	* If you have text on a picture, it should contrast sharply with a background
		* Can also help to put a shadow effect
		
## Other Things:
* Image aspect ratio is so important
* Humans have a "golden ratio"
	* The proportions matter
	* Do Not mess it up
* Background images can be done in layers, one on top of the other.
	* If you're layering images, DO NOT let the text touch the other image. It loses all depth and looks really goofy and wrong. Keep them shifted away from each other.
* Background images can be tiled
* Can make an image on top look like it has a shadow on the image below it, to give the set-up depth
* Can use transparency to great effect
