## REALLY AWESOME HELPFUL THING FOR POOR BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO CAN'T AFFORD PHOTOSHOP:
    HEYO guess what you can do a lot of stuff PowerPoint that you would otherwise do in Photoshop! It can help you out a lot, no joke.
- You format (size-wise and stuff) make posters in it for printing really well
- You can edit photos and crop them and stuff and make transparency happen, etc. etc.
- You can make images into circles with transparency outside of the area you've selected so they can be used as icons or for structural design pieces on a webpage
