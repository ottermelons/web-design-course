# THIS CHAPTER (Chapter 5) IS REALLY IMPORTANT

## Four Font Families:
- Serif
- Sans-Serif
- Monospace
- Cursive (script?)

It's recommended to use Serif for headings and Sans-Serif for normal text, usually. And those two are the ones that you'll use normally.

_Look up later:_ [urbanfonts serif vs. sans]

(http://www.urbanfonts.com/blog/2013/02/serif-vs-sans-the-final-battle/)

- Monospace = like a typewriter. Every letter is the same size.
    - Because of same-sizing but different amounts of space around different kinds of letters, this used to need two spaces after periods on typewriters and with older computers and stuff

## Specifying Fonts:

- First font mentioned: that's the font you want the browser to use
- Next font(s) you can use this instead of the first font or previous font(s)
- At the end, specify the font family you're trying to use fonts from. This hands over control to the browser in case it can't display any of the fonts you specified.

** When you're creating your own pages, you want everything to be nicely self-contained—keep everything within your own site server, so the browser doesn't have to go out and go through the whole process again to pull information from a link you used. **

## Font sizing:

- Ems and Percentages make responsive text size

- Pt is really for printed text, not "good practice" for the web

- Pixels are absolute (don't change) but depend on the screen size/pixel density and ratios
    - So if the dots are larger, the text will be larger. If the resolution is really high, the text will be smaller.
    
- "Absolute" makes the text size the same, no matter what the screen size or resolution

## Images and text alignment:

- Images by default will have text aligned to the bottom right.
- The text will often look better aligned to the middle of the image, or to the top (and more text, like a paragraph, wraps around the image to the right and down)

—as long as we know what it looks like!

## CSS 3:
-CSS3 is like HTML5
